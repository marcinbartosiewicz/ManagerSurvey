# ManagerSurvey
Hi, this is my own data science project. The data is from "Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021". I thought it would be interesting to build a Ml model to predict an annual salary by some features in the data.
There are three files in this repo:
1. Preprocessing- Getting data ready for machine learning model
2. DataVisualization- Graphs(To see graphs, click on Open in Colab)
3. MLModel- Model selection and evaluation
